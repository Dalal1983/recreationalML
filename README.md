# recreationalML
Small projects undertaken to learn new machine learning practices

You will find the code of tutorials that I followed, or closed kaggle competitions I chose to work on for fun and self improvement.
This is not a unified project, so commits are not meant to be related.

For the moment, I use this repository to store code already written in local, so there might be very few commits.
